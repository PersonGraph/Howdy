### Meeting of the Minds
I'm able/willing to github stuff. I _don't_ want do github stuff that has a likelihood of having bad things happen.  [Here's some limitations I've already found](./LIMITATIONS.md).  

_Some of this will start off as venting, take it at that!_

This repo is set to [public|private], so [you can share it all you want | I'd like explicit permission before this is shared].

- [ ] [I understand](./INDEX.md)
